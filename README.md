# SailPoint_Public

# repository consists of two folders - all folders other folders are private

# In the previous instance, all SP data originated from a 'source of truth' HR database.  The HR data base supplied SailPoint with the necessary data to input users in to roles > leading to 'who gets what' during the account creation (joiners), account transfer (movers), and terminated users (leavers)

# The actual database and tasklist names used in the prior instance are renamed to 'data.base.123' or [data].[base].[123]
